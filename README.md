# News-Headline-Generation-using-LSTM
Text generation is a challenge with linguistic modelling. The basic issue for a number of linguistic processing tasks, including word-to-text, conversational and text summarization, is language modelling. The probability of a word occurence depending on the preceding sequence of words used in the text is learned by an educated language model. Models of linguistic languages can be handled at the level of characters, n-gram, phrase or even paragraph levels.
I will utilise this Kernel for a text-generated language model to produce news items utilising the New York Times Comments and Headlines datasets.
